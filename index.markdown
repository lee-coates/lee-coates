- <span style='font-size:1em;'>&#129305;</span> Hi, I’m @lee-coates, a citizen developer from the U.S.
- <span style='font-size:1em;'>&#129404;&#127797;</span> I love science and nature, and I like to make tools that make people smile.
- <span style='font-size:1em;'>&#127926;</span> I’m currently working on community websites, improving my own skills, and supporting open knowledge.
- <span style='font-size:1em;'>&#129529;</span> I’m looking to collaborate on open source tooling, and I hope to help out the ecosystem as much as possible.
